# PDF-ultrasplit

Console utility that splits multi-page PDF files into separate pages.

The utility allows you to split PDF documents into separate pages saved in PDF format. In order to split a PDF file, just drag it onto the executable file of the utility and wait for the utility to complete.

Upon completion of the utility, a folder with the same name will appear next to your file, inside which there will be a set of separate PDF files with pages of the original document.
If you have a folder with many multi-page PDF files, you can throw the entire folder at the utility, the utility will split each PDF file in the folder in a similar way. (files must be located in the folder itself, subdirectories are not processed)
